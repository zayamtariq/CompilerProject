Learned a valuable lesson today, in terms of design choices. 

1. Always include dependencies on other files in .h files. 
2. Your .c file should only have one file dependency: to it's own h file. 
3. There should be no cycles in your dependencies. It should just be one straight, linear path. 

This can save a lot of headache in the future.
