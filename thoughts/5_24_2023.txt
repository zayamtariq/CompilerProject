i have come from hell and back to work on this project. i am once again going to blindly believe that there is hope for the future. 
i have to. i think a big fear of mine is: "what's the point of working on all of this stuff and contributing to society if i feel so isolated
all of the time?" i think this is a valid thought, honestly. all thoughts are valid, but this one especially so. a good engineer needs people 
around him to do his best work. engineers can only contribute to a society that they care about. engineering isn't about locking 
yourself in a room for hours just coding. it's about spending time with your family and people you love, and THEN locking yourself in a room 
for hours just coding. it gives you a reason to code. i think i need to my family i love them more. 

ALSO, if you don't make time for maintenance, time will be made for you. ok thanks. 

what i want to do today/tomorrow: 
- review what i've done so far (not that much, but still. make sure we have all our eggs in one basket.) 
- figure out how to parse expressions in PEMDAS order. 

so the reason that no precedence exists is that all mathematical operations are viewed the same way. 
we can alter this such that we have a new tree where division and multiplication take priority. 
this takes a long time to actually execute, with all the function calls needed to ensure the correct level 
of precedence. there would have to be a unique function for every single precedence level, which by the end of 
this whole project would be a lot. 

there is an alternative called pratt parsing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator-precedence_parser#Pratt_parsing 
which takes care of precedence in a better way.
